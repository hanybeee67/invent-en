# Data (If local only, keep structure but ignore content?)
# User said "Keep data files", but usually we ignore local data if production uses Render disk.
# However, user uses CSVs in repo. So we KEEP data csvs in git?
# Wait, user said "data(csv ... preserve)".
# If I gitignore them, they won't be pushed.
# Let's NOT gitignore csvs unless user asked. The prompt said "Google keys... gitignore".
# It didn't say gitignore csvs.
